🏠 House Price Prediction 
📘 Overview

An end-to-end Data Science project predicting house prices based on multiple property features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and location-based metrics.
The project includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering and selection

Ridge Regression with hyperparameter tuning

Model evaluation

Deployment using Streamlit

📊 Dataset

The dataset includes features like:

Living area

Number of bedrooms/bathrooms

House grade and condition

Distance from airport, schools nearby
price per sqft

🧠 Model

The final model uses Ridge Regression, optimized using GridSearchCV for best hyperparameters.
It provides stable, interpretable predictions while avoiding overfitting.

💻 Streamlit App
